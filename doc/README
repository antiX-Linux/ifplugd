                                 ifplugd 0.28
Overview

   ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your
   ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and automatically
   unconfigure it if the cable is pulled. This is useful on laptops with
   onboard network adapters, since it will only configure the interface
   when a cable is really connected.

   ifplugd ifplugd interfaces with your distribution's native network
   configuration utilities.

   Some features:
     * Uses your distribution's native ifup/ifdown programs.
     * May beep when the cable is unplugged, plugged, the interface
       configuration succeeded or failed.
     * Supports the Linux SIOCETHTOOL (newer, aka ethtool API),
       SIOCGMIIREG (older, aka mii-diag/mii-tool API) and SIOCDEVPRIVATE
       (oldest, aka mii-tool API) ioctl()s for getting link status.
       Release 0.24 introduces support for link detection with the
       IFF_RUNNING interface flag.
     * Syslog support
     * Small program - the binary is just 25 KB (plus 16 KB for
       libdaemon).
     * Multiple ethernet interface support
     * Can be configured to ignore short "unplugged" periods (-d option)
       or short "plugged" periods(-u option)
     * Support for wireless networking. Whenever an association to an AP
       is detected the network is configured. Have a look on [29]waproamd
       if you need a facility to configure WEP keys before AP
       associations succeed.
     * Compatibility mode for network devices which do not support cable
       detection (-F option)

Current Status

   Version 0.28 is stable and has all the sensible features its users
   could think of.

Documentation

   Have a look on the man pages [30]ifplugd(8), [31]ifplugstatus(8),
   [32]ifplugd.conf(5). (An XSLT capable browser is required)

  Configuration

   Edit /etc/ifplugd/ifplugd.conf for configuration changes. This file is
   a bourne shell script sourced by the init script and used to start
   ifplugd with appropriate arguments. You may specify more than one
   ethernet interface in INTERFACES. For each interface a seperate
   instance of ifplugd is spawned. The arguments specified in ARGS are
   append to ifplugd's command line. Have a look on ifplugd -h or man
   ifplugd for further information about the available options.

   The network interface which is controlled by ifplugd should not be
   configured automatically by your distribution's network subsystem,
   since ifplugd will do this for you if needed.

   On Debian systems, any interfaces named in ifplugd's INTERFACES
   environment variable should not also be listed in an "auto" stanza in
   /etc/network/interfaces.

  Troubleshooting

   When you are using the hotplug subsystem (Debian package hotplug) you
   may notice that the network device is configured even when it is not
   listed on an auto line in /etc/network/interfaces. This may be due to
   hotplug being configured to ifup the network interface when it becomes
   available. This was the default behavior in the Debian hotplug package
   prior to release 0.0.20030117-1, for example. To prevent this you
   should either upgrade your hotplug package or comment out the ifup
   call in /etc/hotplug/net.agent.

   When using ifplugd together with APM (and probably ACPI) suspends,
   strange things may happen: some network devices fail to detect the
   network cable for a short period of time before and after the suspend.
   When using the -f switch, this will be treated as "no link beat", thus
   the network is shutdown after a timeout. During this timeout the
   machine changes to suspended state. When it is resumed again, the
   timeout period will have expired and so the network is deconfigured,
   however, as the next cable detection succeeds, the network is
   configured again immediately. To fix this problem, ifplugd should be
   disabled before the APM suspend and enabled back after the suspend.
   This may be done by using apmd and adding a script to
   /etc/apm/{suspend,resume}.d which simply calls /etc/init.d/ifplugd
   suspend, resp. /etc/init.d/ifplugd resume. It might even be a good
   idea to shut down the network completely during suspend, this may be
   achieved by calling /etc/init.d/ifplugd stop and /etc/init.d/ifplugd
   start in the appropriate places. I strongly urge the packagers of this
   software for the Linux distributions to add such scripts to their
   packages.

Requirements

   A newer Linux Kernel (I think 2.2 is good enough, alltough I tested it
   only with 2.4) with a compatible device driver and ethernet card. Most
   modern cards and drivers are compatible, like mine which works with
   the 8139too driver.

   ifplugd was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   July 2003, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and maybe
   Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and GNU libtool for source
   code configuration and shared library management.

   The machine used was a Medion 9580-F laptop with a Realtek 8139
   network card and a PRISM1 PCMCIA wireless LAN card.

   ifplugd needs [36]libdaemon.

Acknowledgements

   For the developers of mii-diag, ethtool and laptop-net, since I looked
   on their source codes for learning how to use the link beat ioctls.
